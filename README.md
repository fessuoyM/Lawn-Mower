This is a Personal Project I am taking on to help in learning about machine learning, specifically CNN. I intend to create my own CNN library in Python and implement said library in autonomous lawn mower. The lawn mower is scheduled to use the camera for detection of lawn areas, people near by for safety, and mapping.

TODO list:
-Coding:
  -Create a CNN library
  -Create a website for control and status updates
    -Allow for scheduling
    -Detect rain and adjust schedule accordingly
    -Live stream of camera?
  -Create code to mow the lawn lol
    -Map out area to be mowed by following edges
    -Avoid obstacles
    -Detect humans within safe range and pause operations
    -Turn on edging tool when appropriate
    -Use weed cutter attachment to cut grass next to obstacles
-3D Modeling:
  -Lawnmower:
    -Circuit holder
    -Edge Trimmer
    -Weed Whacker
    -Drive Train
  -Housing:
    -Rain Detector
    -Charger
    -Internet Connectivity
